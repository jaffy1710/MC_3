Set Up Project: Create a new Android Studio project and set up the necessary configurations.
Define Data Model: Define a data model class to represent sensor data. This class should contain fields to store data such as timestamp, sensor values (e.g., x, y, z axes for accelerometer), etc.
Set Up Room Database: Implement a Room database to store sensor data. Define an Entity class for the sensor data and a Data Access Object (DAO) interface to perform database operations.
Implement Sensor Collection: Use the Android Sensor API to collect sensor data. Register sensor listeners in your activity or service to receive sensor updates. When sensor data is received, store it in the Room database.
Display Sensor Data: Create a user interface to display sensor data. You can use RecyclerView or Jetpack Compose to create dynamic UIs. Retrieve sensor data from the Room database and display it in a list or chart.
